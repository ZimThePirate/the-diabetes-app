## 🩺 Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects how the body regulates blood sugar (glucose). It occurs when the pancreas either doesn't produce enough insulin or the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.

Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage the heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, and other organs. With millions affected globally, diabetes is a major public health concern.

**Early detection, regular monitoring, and proper lifestyle management** are essential to prevent complications and improve quality of life.

## ❗ The Problem

- Diabetes is **irreversible**, but **preventable** with early action.
- Lack of **early detection** delays treatment.
- Patients rarely **track reports** or health trends.
- Trusted, **personalized advice** is hard to find early on.
